              Cryptocurrencies are of great interest to the finance community right now.  Their possible impacts on the global economy are being investigated, and it seems likely that some form of block chain currency will be adopted by nations, as official currencies.  Currently, these currencies can be traded on the stock market and show marked volatility as their underlying worth is unclear.  Being able to predict what factors influence cryptocurrency prices could be a key factor is understating why they are so volatile and what could be done to help stabilize them enough to be used an official currency.  It is also of great interest to investors to be able to predict the behavior of these coins and take advantage of these predictions to grow investment accounts.

              We use a basic machine learning model from the prophet library to see how well price data over time alone can predict future prices and how ar in the future the predictions appear to be accurate. Prophet uses time and price information to predict future prices.

            <h2> LSTM Neural Network Model </h2>
            <p>
              We needed a model that could handle the time aspect of price changes while incorporating far more features than the prophet model limited us to. A Long Short-Term Memory model seemed like the obvious choice. Although this model would take longer to train than a random forest (for example), it was able to consider a time windowâ€™s worth of data to make a decision on the future price. Furthermore, this type of model is designed for handling data with a time component. The model choice did not change between sections 2 and 3. This is a regression model, not a classification model, so there is no confusion matrix. The accurary score was always zero, because the model almost nerver perfectly predicted the next day's price. 
            </p>
            <h4> Features </h4>
            <p>
              For feature engineering, see the pre-processing and post-processing sections above. Our exploratory analysis had shown that market behavior alone is not produce a good predictive model. For this model, we chose to retest the market possibility with more market data (e.g. volume traded). We also want to see if how a coin is talked about on social media affects its price. Finally, we think that the best model would be one that incorporated both price and market data. The features under these categories are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Market Features</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Opening price</li>
                <li>High price for the day</li>
                <li>Low price for the day</li>
                <li>volume traded</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Reddit Features</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Number of posts</li>
                <li>Average number of comments per post</li>
                <li>Average score per post</li>
                <li>Average compound sentiment score</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p> The target for the LSTM models was the closing price. See crypto-coin pages for graphs and statistics.</p>
